         Maybe it's the way you say my name <br>
Maybe it's the way you play your game<br>
But it's so good, I've never known anybody like you<br>
But it's so good, f nobody like you<br>
And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime<br>
And I'm pretty sure that yoI've never dreamed ou are that love of mine<br>
'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions<br>
Wishing on every one that you'll be mine, mine<br>
And I see forever in your eyes <br>
I feel okay when I see you smile, smile<br>
Wishing on dandelions all of the time<br>
Praying to God that one day you'll be mine<br>
Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time<br>
I think that you are the one for me<br>
'Cause it gets so hard to breathe<br>
When you're looking at me<br>
I've never felt so alive and free<br>
When you're looking at me<br>
I've never felt so happy<br>
And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime<br>
And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine<br>
'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions<br>
Wishing on every one that you'll be mine, mine<br>
And I see forever in your eyes<br>
I feel okay when I see you smile, smile<br>
Wishing on dandelions all of the time<br>
Praying to God that one day you'll be mine<br>
Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time<br>
Won't you let my darling know?<br>
Dandelion, into the wind you go<br>
Won't you let my darling know that?<br>
I'm in a field of dandelions<br>
Wishing on every one that you'll be mine, mine<br>
And I see forever in your eyes<br>
I feel okay when I see you smile, smile<br>
Wishing on dandelions all of the time<br>
Praying to God that one day you'll be mine<br>
Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time<br>
I'm in a field of dandelions<br>
Wishing on every one that you'll be mine, min
